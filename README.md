# CS-Final-Project-
 I created an avoidance game based of the code from https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex. I followed most of his videos to get where i am now. I then made some changes so it would make sense for what i wanted, which was to be more of a soccer based game. I then added other features, like more defenders and speeds and things like that. My biggest obsticle was remebering how to use clases and getting the defenders to work. I also struggled a lot with getting the colsions to work how I wanted to. I ended up fixing it a little, but not that to the degree that I wanted too.
