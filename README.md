# CS-Final-Project-
 I created an avoidance game based of the code from https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex. I followed most of his videos to get where i am now. I then made some changes so it would make sense for what i wanted, which was to be more of a soccer based game. I then added other features, like more defenders and speeds and things like that. My biggest obsticle was remebering how to use clases and getting the defenders to work. I also struggled a lot with getting the colsions to work how I wanted to. I ended up fixing it a little, but not that to the degree that I wanted too. I started off slow with this project, but then picked up pace after a couple weeks. I porcatinated during the end which led to me not getting as far as I watned to. I wanted to write more classes where the user could pick who the defender was and based on that they would have different feature, but I did not get to it. I also wanted to do a similar thing, but with the player.
